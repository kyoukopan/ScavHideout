# Scav Hideout

Currently under development.

This is a server mod for SPT-AKI, developed with **v3.7.6**. Adds a custom trader, Scav Hideout, which has in scav-tier equipment and services. 

When playing with the [Traveler](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1212-traveler) mod and location-based traders, the early game can be difficult. Even when at a location with a trader, the base game traders only sell limited categories of items. You can buy meds when you visit Therapist, but if you want gear you need to go elsewhere, and vice versa when visiting the gear/weapon traders. On top of this, scav runs are not supported/recommended when using Traveler, so using a scav is out of the question. This can leave you out of gear or supplies.

## The Hideouts

The Scav Hideout trader represents local scav communities who are willing to trade and provide services to your PMC - although scavs are ruthless towards PMCs in-raid, hideouts are willing to do business with PMCs as they recognize they're a useful source of money. In return, scavs very generously agree not to kill you within their hideout.

The goods for sale are the finest (e.g. probably damaged) scav-tier equipment and weapons as well as meds and provisions. They'll repair your gear (poorly) for cheap and you can even insure with them: just don't expect a group of scavs to have very good chances of bringing back your stuff.
